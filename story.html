      <h3 class="title">RISK - A LITERACY NARRATIVE</h3>  
      <p class="text">Me and risk have a love-hate relationship: risk is dangerously unpredictable, but it is the gateway to limitless reward.<br><br>

        It’s 2016, I’m with my mom as we think of where to continue our adventure back from our operation at Chuck-E-Cheese. I feel safe around her knowing she’s my guardian angel, for I know the bubble outside the two of us is dangerous. The epigram of Murphy’s Law was made apparent to me when I watched Interstellar as an 8-year-old – “Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong” – only fuels the burning fear within me for thinking of the worse outcome.  The thought of anything that is remotely threatening to me makes me think I will trigger my fight-or-flight, so I don’t ever want to approach risk.<br><br> 
        
        My mom tells me of a new place in Manassas Mall. I can never interfere with her shopaholic symptoms, so I unwillingly accept. We go inside, I wander aimlessly as she buries herself in clothes, and we get the usual McDonalds from the food court. Everything feels moderate, predictable, and stable as if the feeling is of experiencing a train ride home from the usual commute or as if a slice of untoasted bread was the only meal in your diet. Soon, I subconsciously drift around the mall. As I approach the end, I hear a high-pitched noise as if a plethora of bees were pollinating a field. I see a big red sign inscribed with “Autobahn: Indoor Speedway.”<br><br>
        
        Nothing had ever been so enthralling up until this point in my minute existence. Inside is a warehouse-like interior with a track spanning the size of what I think is half of the mall, décor suited to the passionate racer given the giant road sign with the simple yet vigorous phrase “NO SPEED LIMIT,” and the zipping of the numerous go-karts in which they attracted my attention. My naïve mind is unable to comprehend if what I am looking at is real since I feel like I found a secret gate within the magical land of Manassas Mall. Excited but my mom not being with me, I skedaddle to search for her as fast as my little legs could. I tell her about the magic I beheld, and she lets out a hearty laugh. She offers to take me to the magical place, so I invariably accept. We arrive and she lets out a shock of amazement, but also a concern that would seem inconsiderable to someone else. I won’t attach any significance to it because all I want to do is be one of the go-karts zooming along the track.<br><br> 
        
        My mother makes my racer ID and I take my photo for the account. Then, we get a briefing on the safety and rules of the track. There is a plethora of etiquette to follow when on the track and a number of flags you must know to obey; I never knew that racing could be so serious. The briefing created a slight, overwhelming feeling of pressure as if I didn’t know what I was doing. I know I’m afraid of the unknown, but the briefing was not enough for me to get in the way of my eagerness and not put on the helmet and strap myself in the harness of the kart.<br><br> 
        
        The Autobahn worker sparks the electric motor and checks my condition. I’m fired up. I feel excitement flowing from the grip of my hands to the heavy steering rack and to the chassis. The gate opens and the line of karts flows out of the pits spilling onto the track. The karts start off slow as the racers adjust to their karts and warm up the tires. Suddenly, everyone starts moving faster than me ultimately overtaking me with ease.<br><br>
        I have no clue what happening to me. My heart rate starts to increase like I’m in a sprint. I’m panicking thinking I broke something and I’m going to crash. I move to the side away from the racing line so I don’t block anyone incoming or exiting a corner. I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong by taking advantage of my overthinking mentality by thinking of every possible solution to a scenario except for the safety video.<br><br> 
        
        After four laps, I adjusted myself to the machine, and I start to get bored. I see my mom recording and waving at me. “Of course,” I thought. “She wanted to see me race.” I remember one point from the briefing: when you complete the first lap, your kart unlocks its full speed.  A burst of confidence gravitates my foot into the throttle, and I meet the serious acceleration of the instantaneous torque from the Italian electric motor as it pulls my stomach to the back of my spine. The g-forces from the velocity as I enter the tight corners are incomparable to even a roller-coaster. Nothing is as liberating as flying through a warehouse in a tiny 50-mile-per-hour rocket.<br><br>
        
        The race is over. The feeling of relief I hoped to expect after the race from the fear in the first 5 laps is nonexistent, rather, I feel a craving for more adrenaline. I’m experiencing an ecstasy that alleviates my fear. I think I want more.<br><br>
        
        As I race more, I fear less of risk, but I approach risk in more magnitudes. Whether it’s achieving a faster lap time or beating my racing line, the risk of the goals I chase in my go-kart increases as my goals get more ambitious – a direct correlation. I don’t put much consideration into the risk of racing itself as the danger is merely a repellent towards a truer, greater resolution. The outcome of which is beautiful. The result is entering the zone during a race. The adrenaline rush from the speed and acceleration of the car turns everything around me still as if time has stopped and the minute details of the surrounding environment turn into a blur like they never existed – it’s ecstasy like no other.<br><br> 
        
        As I keep approaching risk and ambivalence with confidence and optimism, I travel to places that I never knew I could reach. New roads are paved from the opportunities I opened by unlocking the doors of my closed mind and new peaks are climbed at faster rates than my competitors by tuning my mental and physical ability. The lack of fear or the amplitude of courage is key to how successful we are.<br><br> 
        
        As I grow older, I receive new incentives and toys. I have my driver's license, and I’m fortunate enough to be able to have a car to commute to school and go wherever I please. I’m also fortunate enough to be driving a tasteful car: the 2021 Lexus GX460. The drivetrain is engineered from a naturally aspirated 4.6L V8 making 301 horsepower and 329 pound-feet of torque. The luxury off-road SUV can pull you from 0 to 60 mph in 7.8 seconds. The more I drive it, the more I push its limits. Flooring the car from rest transfers a great deal of the weight into the rear causing the front to tilt up like a G-Wagon, and the V8 as I pull in 3rd gear growls like a predator attacking helpless prey. Eventually, I look forward to taking it off-road in the dangerous environment of the desert leading me to new courage I never knew I could obtain.<br><br> 
        
        But I crave more risk. The icing on the cake – my mother’s Mercedes AMG E53 Coupé - the embellishment of the passion for driving. Fitted with the German-crafted AMG-enhanced turbocharged 3.0L straight 6, it outputs a compelling 429 horsepower. The intoxicating ambiance of the interior hypnotizes its driver with the spell of thrill and comfort. I know because I’m a victim of its power, but also a follower of its wizardry. I sit inside, and the aroma from the perfume diffuser instantly seduces me. The cockpit greets me with the brilliant choreography of its ambient lighting. Above me are the constellations shining through the panoramic roof. And in front of me is the thick microfiber steering wheel with the cold aluminum paddle shifters behind it. On the bottom of the wheel lies the “AMG” emblem to remind the caster’s subject that it’s meant to be driven with passion. I immediately understood what the car wanted me to do, and I felt obliged to fulfill its purpose.<br><br>
        
        I ignite the engine and it responds with a melody from the exhaust system as if I’m a conductor orchestrating the band of brilliant mechanical engineering in the drivetrain. I put in in drive and make my way to the backroads. “Decades of knowledge and engineering contributed to this German machine,” I whisper to myself, so I want to take the risk of not letting it go to waste since I’m on backroads during the night - a hotspot for highspeed crashes. I put the car in Individual mode unlocking the full potential of the machine. The AMG suddenly shifts from a comfortable, lightweight cruising mode to a vigorous, precise Sport+ mode unlocking the paddle shifting capabilities, stiffening the suspension, and configuring the ESP (Electronic Stability Program) to transfer as much control to me. I sink my foot into the pedal and suddenly the force of a rocket ship taking off and the wind from a tornado spinning encapsulates my body as I sink into the seat. I upshift, and the AMG Speedshift TCT 9G transmission driving the Performance 4Matic drivetrain aggressively rocks my head forward in complete malice as if the aggressiveness was a mark of its ego. I flow through the corners like leaves of autumn in the win - graceful and fast. The G-Force builds up, I grip harder on the wheel, and my arms start to become swell. The pistons in the I6 become the only sound I hear as I roar through every thousandth of an RPM as well as the turbos suck the dense air as I heed through the road, the acceleration from the torque out of each corner and straight makes me wish for more as I shift down from every gear, the smell of gas and oil while I push the car to its limit reminds me of its lively energy, and the only thing I see is the tunnel vision from immense focus as I speed up while turning everything around me frozen. Risk has no meaning to me at this moment.<br><br>
        
        It was like my first race at Autobahn. The risk that repelled me so much was a mere mask to experiencing a feeling greater than what we already know. The thrill of speed is a drug like no other, an ecstasy to the ego death, everything else becomes meaningless and the goal of going faster takes paramount focus. I understand what it means to be successful after the drive ended – achieving peak consciousness. If this is what’s possible after taking a big risk, then I’ll take as much risk as I can handle. I’ll pursue it with what I have in my disposable and make the most of it whether it’s a Japanese off-roader or a German Sports Coupe, I’m in love with risk.<br><br>
